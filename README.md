# OPAM 2025 Workshop: Reproducible Manuscripts in R and Quarto

Open Science practices—centered on transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility—are becoming increasingly essential in psychology. In this 2-hour workshop, you’ll learn how to set up a fully reproducible workflow to generate a publication-ready manuscript that seamlessly integrates data, R or Python code, text, and references. Special emphasis will be placed on formatting APA-style manuscripts. Additionally, I’ll introduce Nix/Rix as a solution for managing package and system dependencies to ensure long-term reproducibility.
