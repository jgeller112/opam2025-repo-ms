## Rstudio

**1. Create an RStudio Project**

-   In RStudio, click *File* \> *New Project* \> *Existing Directory*.
-   Browse to your folder `my-reproducible-manuscript` in which you have saved the workshop materials.
-   Check the *Open in new session* option.
-   Click *Create Project*. This will create a `my-reproducible-manuscript.Rproj` file.

**2. Document your project for reproducibility**

Your project already contains pre-made folders and a README . Open the `README.md` file and fill it with a few relevant details, for example:

-   Purpose and contents of the project
-   Your name (Author)
-   The date of creation
-   Etc.

**3. Create a Quarto document for your manuscript.**

-   In RStudio, open up the `index.qmd` file
-   In the YAML
    -   Change the title: `My Reproducible Manuscript`.
    -   Change the affiliation

**4. Render the Quarto document to HTML**

-   Save the Quarto document as something different within the `my-reproducible-manuscript` folder.
    -   Give the file a clear name, without using spaces. For example, `my-reproducible-manuscript.qmd`.
-   Once everything has been saved correctly, click the *Render* button in the menu bar.
-   The rendered HTML copy of your document will appear in your web browser or alongside the editor in RStudio. You will also see a `my-reproducible-manuscript.html` file appear in the \_manuscripts folder.
