## Exercise: Referencing

We're assuming installation of Zotero Desktop, Zotero Connector, and Better BibTex for Zotero were completed successfully.

1.  Open **Zotero Desktop**

-   log into your account
-   create a new collection for your project, for example: `my-reproducible-manuscript`

2.  Open your **Web Browser**

-   double-check that you can find the **Zotero Connector** in your browser
-   run a web / Google Scholar search for "Allison Horst PalmerPenguins Package"
-   use the Zotero Connector to save the reference to your collection

3.  In **Zotero Desktop**,

-   Right-click your collection and select *Export Collection*
-   For the **Format**, select *Better BibTex*
-   Click the option to *Keep updated*
-   Provide the file name as `references` and **save it in the same folder as your Quarto document**

4.  In **RStudio**,

-   update the YAML to include the bibliography:

```         
---
title: "My Reproducible Manuscript"
format: html
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

5.  **Insert a Citation**

-   In the text of your Quarto document, insert the *PalmerPenguins* citation (hint: refer to the slides and your .bib file to figure how to format the citation)

-   Alternatively, when using the Visual Editor option - you can use the citation dialog/option to insert citations directly.

-   Render the document

6.  **Repetition**

-   Repeat Step 2 with another reference
-   Repeat Step 5 to insert the new reference
-   if you did a bracketed citation before, do an in-text citation this time (or vice versa)

**Note:** Steps 1, 3, 4 can be skipped. These were a one-time thing.
